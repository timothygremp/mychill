## 🌿 What It Does

MyChill lets users generate guided meditations tailored to their exact needs, in real time.

- Feeling anxious before bed? Create a calm, sleepy session.
- Need motivation before a workout? Generate an energizing one.
- Want something spiritual, silly, or specific? Just type it in.

MyChill creates spoken audio using OpenAI's language model and delivers it in a soft, focused format.

## 🧠 How It Works

- 📝 Users describe how they feel or what they need (e.g., “calm me down after a stressful day”)
- 🤖 MyChill sends that prompt to OpenAI’s API with meditation-style constraints
- 🗣️ The app returns a script, reads it aloud, and plays it as a calming audio session
- 🎛️ Optionally choose background sounds like ocean, rain, or wind

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- `SwiftUI` – Native iOS frontend
- `OpenAI API` – Custom GPT prompts for meditation scripting
- `AVFoundation` – Text-to-speech engine to deliver the meditation
- `Custom UI` – Minimal, focus-enhancing interface

## 🎯 Why I Built It

I wanted to build a practical, calming AI use case—not just a chatbot.  
MyChill is designed to help people regulate their mood, prepare for moments of stress, or wind down when life is overwhelming. It’s a lightweight tool that adapts to the user.

This project combines:
- My passion for mental wellness
- My product mindset (customization > generic)
- My technical skills (SwiftUI + API integration)
